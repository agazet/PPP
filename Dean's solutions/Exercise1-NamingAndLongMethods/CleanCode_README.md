Problems with Naming and Long Methods

"Clean Code" is code that is easy to read and understand. This is
true of the System Under Test (SUT) as well as the tests themselves.

We've been getting some hints about feature enhancements to
the Catalog and DataServices classes.  Take a look at those two
classes and their tests. Can you easily understand what is going on
in that code? If so, go ahead and take the rest of the afternoon off.

If not, then you're like most people. In this case, please open
your refactoring toolkit and spend some time cleaning up this
code by improving the names and any Long Methods that you find.
Remember that a Long Method is not judged by how many lines of code,
but rather whether or not it is doing more than one thing.
